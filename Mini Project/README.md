Excited to share my Mini Project completion – The Great Pizza Analytics Challenge!  

As part of the 21-Day SQL Challenge by Indian Data Club (powered by DPDzero), I stepped into the shoes of a Data Analyst at IDC Pizza to convert raw sales data into meaningful business insights.

Project Highlights  
Designed & built the complete database schema in MySQL  
Imported and cleaned 48k+ order records from CSV files  
Explored data using WHERE, LIKE, IN, and time-based filters  
Performed deep sales analysis with GROUP BY, HAVING, SUM, AVG  
Mastered complex JOINs – including SELF JOIN to calculate price differences across pizza sizes (S → M → L → XL) of the same pizza type  
Delivered a complete presentation summarizing all findings and insights  

One of my favorite learnings: using SELF JOIN to dynamically compare prices of the same pizza across different sizes – a real game-changer for menu pricing analysis!

Huge thanks to Indian Data Club and DPDzero for organizing this hands-on challenge. It was the perfect mix of theory and real-world application.
